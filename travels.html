      <p>In my free time, I love to enjoy all that Seattle has to offer. Whether visiting beautiful parks, kayaking in the lake, visiting my favorite breweries, or going to incredible performances, I try and take advantage of all the possibilities each day. And if my dogs can come with me, all the better!

      Admittedly, I am dog obsessed. One of the apps I aspire to make is a travel planner for fellow dog-minded people to plan trips where dogs are not only welcome to come, but guaranteed to enjoy.

      Below are some photos of my dogs, my BF James, and various other sightings from travels. I apologize in advance for the terrible formatting.
